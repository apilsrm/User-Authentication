#  Readme

This README provides an overview of how to use the project. In this example, we have a simple to  Develop a User Authentication System with CRUD operations using React.js for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end. This application will allow users to sign up, log in, view their profile, update their profile, and delete their account that uses Redux for state management. We'll cover the main components: actions, reducers, and the store.
